================================================================================

1. Summary
----------
libfbi requires variadic templates or Boost MPL + Preprocessor, which will act as a fallback.
Via CMake, the capabilities of your compiler will be detected automagically, 
copying the correct header files to your build directory.
Make install will copy the correspondent files to the standard include directory.

2. Options
----------
By default, variadic templates will be used if available.
If you are developing for multiple platforms/compilers with different capabilities, 
you may want to disable the CMake-Option
"USE_C++1X" so the Boost-Headers will get used instead.
Multhreading support can be enabled via the option "ENABLE_MULTITHREADING", 
which requires either C++1X or linking against Boost_THREAD_LIBRARY for your own libraries, 
you'll be given a warning during the CMake initialization.
